# simple_agent 🤖

**simple_agent** is a lightweight AI agent powered by Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model, integrated using the OpenAI-compatible Agents SDK. This assistant is designed to provide quick, reliable answers to user queries with minimal setup. Using environment variables for API security and a synchronous runner for simplicity, it serves as an ideal starting point for experimenting with agent-based architectures. 🌍📡

The agent connects to the Gemini API through a compatible client and wraps the model in a structured `Agent` interface. Its instructions define a helpful assistant capable of answering general knowledge questions—like identifying the capital of Pakistan 🇵🇰. With tracing disabled, the setup remains clean and efficient for local use or testing environments.

Whether you're building a chatbot, personal AI tool, or educational assistant, **simple_agent** gives you a solid foundation to build on. Customize instructions, plug in memory or tools, and expand functionality as you go. Happy experimenting! ⚙️🧠
